## MVC Architecture

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

1. **Model**: Handles data logic and communication with the database.
2. **View**: Responsible for rendering the user interface.
3. **Controller**: Acts as the intermediary between Model and View, processing user inputs and executing actions.

This architecture ensures:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Independent development of UI, business logic, and data.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new features.
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modular, and testable code.
